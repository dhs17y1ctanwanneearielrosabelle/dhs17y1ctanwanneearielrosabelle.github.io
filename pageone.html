<h2>Movie Review by Ariel Tan</h2>

  <h3>Review</h3>
<p>I would give Real Steel five out of five stars. 
It is an entertaining and thrilling movie, filled with actions.
It also inculcates good moral values like perseverance and determination. 
The movie is suitable for both adults and children. 
I definitely would recommend Real Steel to others and to those who have not watched this movie, 
grab the chance to watch it for you will not regret!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Although Atom(robot) did not win the match, he was still the first to have damaged Zeus(the strongest robot). 
Max and Charlie’s bond strengthens as they had been training Atom together. 
Their determination and perseverance had got them to the final stage. Real Steel is a touching and valuable movie.</p>
